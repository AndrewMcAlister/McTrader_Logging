REM ============================================================================
REM  Stop McTrader_Logging.
REM ============================================================================
REM
REM  Asks the service to stop itself, via POST /admin/shutdown.
REM
REM  It does not try to kill the process, and that is not laziness: the service
REM  runs in SESSION 0 (Task Scheduler started it) while your shell is session 2,
REM  and a session-2 process cannot terminate a session-0 process -- "Access is
REM  denied", at any run level. A process can always end itself, so the service
REM  is asked to.
REM
REM  Nothing restarts it afterwards: the keep-alive task is boot-only.
REM
REM  If this reports "no answer", the process is not running, or it is wedged and
REM  cannot serve HTTP. A wedged process needs the task route instead:
REM      schtasks /run /tn "McTrader_Logging_KeepAlive_Stop"
REM  That task is created by install-task.ps1 -Install. It is not needed for the
REM  normal case and stop.bat does not depend on it.
REM
REM  For scripted use:
REM      curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8004/admin/shutdown
REM ============================================================================
